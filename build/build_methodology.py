<title>Northwind CRM — Data methodology</title>
<style>{css}</style>
</head>
<body>
<main>
<nav class="crumbs"><a href="./">Northwind CRM case</a> / Data methodology</nav>
<h1>Data methodology</h1>
<div class="date">How the tables were understood, validated, cleaned and joined · Companion to the <a href="analysis.html">Analysis</a></div>

<p class="tldr">We got three raw extracts and no data dictionary. The tables join cleanly on ids (99%+ match rates), but they needed 14 fixes before we could trust them: duplicates, broken keys, amounts recorded 1,000× too high, a sign bug in days to close, out-of-range dates and messy labels. Under 1% of rows needed a fix (not counting URL normalization, which applies to every visit). Every rule is in SQL and every count on this page is queried from the data.</p>

<h2>1. What each table is</h2>
{t_tables}
<p class="note-foot">* 8 signups are dated in July, after sessions end on Jun 30. Corrected in R7.</p>
<p>There's no dictionary, so this is our read of each field from the values, and what we checked to confirm it:</p>
{t_dict}

<h2>2. How the tables connect</h2>
<div class="joinmap">
  <div class="jbox"><div class="n">sessions</div><div class="g">{f0(cln_n['sessions'])} website visits</div></div>
  <div class="jarrow"><span>session_id</span><i></i>1 : 0..1</div>
  <div class="jbox"><div class="n">signups</div><div class="g">{f0(cln_n['signups'])} leads, one product each</div></div>
  <div class="jarrow"><span>lead_id</span><i></i>1 : 0..1</div>
  <div class="jbox"><div class="n">opportunities</div><div class="g">{f0(cln_n['opportunities'])} closed deals</div></div>
</div>
<p>The first instinct with three separate extracts is to line them up by date. We don't need to: the ids connect them row by row, which lets us follow each signup from the visit that produced it to the deal it became. That's what makes the plan and origin cuts in the analysis possible.</p>
{t_join}

<h3>Signup product vs plan bought</h3>
<p><code>product_code</code> (what the lead signed up for) and <code>plan</code> (what they bought) are different fields. Free CRM is not a plan you buy; its upgrades show up as Starter deals.</p>
<div class="two">{t_xwalk}{t_amt}</div>
<p class="note-foot">Counts include $0 deals. Prices didn't change during the period, so this is a packaging change, not a pricing change.</p>

<h2>3. Cleaning rules</h2>
<p>Each rule is numbered in <a href="https://github.com/bald-phoenix/northwind_assessment/blob/main/sql/01_clean.sql">01_clean.sql</a> with the same id. Rows are flagged rather than dropped when they're still useful for some cuts.</p>
{t_rules}

<h3>Checking R7: were the July dates really wrong?</h3>
<p>Two of the eight leads with July signup dates have a closed deal. In both, the raw <code>days_to_close</code> only makes sense if the signup happened on the session date, not in July. One of them closed in March, which would be before its own signup.</p>
{t_imp}

<h3>R2: landing pages after normalizing</h3>
{t_pages}

<h2>4. Definitions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Paying customer (win):</b> an opportunity with amount &gt; $0, closed within 30 days of the signup. We call it "paying customer" because finance defines a customer as a closed opportunity, and $0 deals don't pay.</li>
  <li><b>Cohort:</b> signups grouped by the month they signed up. Conversion is always cohort-based (signup month → did they pay), not close-month based.</li>
  <li><b>Periods:</b> Q1 = Jan–Mar 2026 (before Free CRM), Q2 = Apr–Jun 2026 (after launch). Compared as monthly averages.</li>
  <li><b>Plan:</b> the product the lead signed up for (<code>product_code</code>), not the plan they bought.</li>
  <li><b>Origin attributes</b> (channel, entry page, device): from the signup session, i.e. last touch. 37% of signups had earlier visits; we don't attribute to those.</li>
  <li><b>New vs returning:</b> returning = the visitor had a session on an earlier day than the signup.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Assumptions and why they're safe</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>30-day window.</b> No deal in the extract closes more than {dtc_max} days after signup, so a 30-day window loses nothing. Opportunities run to {o_max:%b %-d}; the {f0(late_signups)} signups after {(o_max - __import__('datetime').timedelta(days=30)):%b %-d} have a slightly shorter window. With a 29-day maximum, the impact is a handful of deals in late June.</li>
  <li><b>$0 deals excluded.</b> {rc['R11']} of {f0(cln_n['opportunities'])} deals, spread evenly across months. Including them doesn't change any trend (see the finance view in the analysis).</li>
  <li><b>Orphan rows kept, not invented.</b> We don't guess the true keys of the {rc['R8']} signups and {rc['R13']} deals with broken ids. They stay in the totals they can support and out of the cuts they can't.</li>
  <li><b>January in the finance view.</b> Some January closes come from December signups, which aren't in the data, so January close-month counts are low. Cohort views aren't affected.</li>
  <li><b>Free CRM in the decomposition.</b> Free CRM has no Q1 conversion rate. The Kitagawa split uses its Q2 rate for both periods, which puts its whole effect in the mix term.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. What the data can't tell us</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Anything inside the product.</b> Sessions are website visits; there are no product logins or usage events. We can't measure activation.</li>
  <li><b>Upgrades after 30 days.</b> No deal closes more than {dtc_max} days after signup, for any SKU, even for April cohorts with ~85 days of history. Either Free CRM users decide in their first month or the extract only captures the first 30 days. A freemium plan usually converts over a longer period, so Free CRM's lifetime conversion could be higher than what we observe.</li>
  <li><b>Free CRM landing page before launch.</b> The Free CRM landing page URLs (<code>/lp/free-crm</code>, <code>/offers/free-crm/</code>) get traffic from January: {f0(lp_q1[0])} sessions in Q1 ({lp_q1_share:.0f}% of Q1 traffic), producing {f0(lp_q1[1])} Starter and Pro signups before the product existed. The same happens with <code>/campaign/spring-2026</code>. It could be a teaser page, a reused URL or an artifact of the extract. Left as is: we can't tell which version is right, and no finding depends on it.</li>
  <li><b>Multi-touch attribution.</b> Only the signup session is linked to the lead.</li>
  <li><b>Direct traffic in June.</b> Direct jumps to 37% of sessions and its signup rate halves. Probably tracking or bots; worth checking at the source.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Reproduce it</h2>
<p>The queries are written in Snowflake SQL and avoid engine-specific functions, so they also run unchanged in <a href="https://duckdb.org">DuckDB</a> on a laptop. In Snowflake, run 01, 02 and 03 against the <code>sessions</code>, <code>signups</code> and <code>opportunities</code> tables. Locally, run <code>00_load_raw.sql</code> first to load the CSVs into tables with those same names. Run from the folder that contains <code>data/</code>.</p>
